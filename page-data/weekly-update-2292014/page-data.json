My first experience was with SVN but Git has had less trouble so far. Bitnami provides a <a href=\"https://bitnami.com/stack/gitlab\">GitLab virtual machine</a> which is by far the easiest option to setup your own Git repository. GitLab has some very nice features like connecting to an Active Directory/LDAP which I did at work, bundled continuous integration and issue tracking. You will find most things similar to GitHub.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wiki\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#wiki\" aria-label=\"wiki permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Wiki</h2>\n<p>There are two popular Wiki software, <a href=\"https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki\">DokuWiki</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki\">MediaWiki</a>. I tried out both and they both had their strengths and weaknesses e.g. DokuWiki was better on mobile devices and MediaWiki has the visual editor. I chose to go with MediaWiki because it's what <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page\">Wikipedia</a> uses - what everyone else uses. Learning how to write articles in MediaWiki will definitely help whoever uses it in writing articles on Wikipedia as well.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pfsense-dmz\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#pfsense-dmz\" aria-label=\"pfsense dmz permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>pfSense DMZ</h2>\n<p>My web servers sat on my management/control VLAN which had access to everything else on my network. This was bad bad bad because they were public Internet facing hosts. If anyone managed to break into them they would've had access to everything on my network. Creating a <a href=\"https://doc.pfsense.org/index.php/PfSense_2_on_VMware_ESXi_5#Adding_a_DMZ\">DMZ on ESXi</a> was also not that difficult. Placing hosts in a DMZ would allow any hacker access to the DMZ network and absolutely nothing else.</p>\n<h2 id=\"interested-in\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#interested-in\" aria-label=\"interested in permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Interested In</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>NZBGet: This has been picking up a lot lately as a replacement for SABnzbd. SAB is still the king but NZBGet is picking up a lot of traction from what I can see. It might be good to switch over eventually or at least give it a try.</li>\n<li>Active Directory/Domain Controller: Adding another user to my network is a pain, having to create a user account literally everywhere. I'm opening up to have a LDAP/Active Directory now.
