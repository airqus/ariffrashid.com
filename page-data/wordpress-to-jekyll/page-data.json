Static sites are just easier, faster and more secure :thumbsup:</p>\n<!-- more -->\n<p>Honestly, what hasn't been said about Jekyll? Static sites are definitely the way to go. I've been hearing about vulnerabilities in <a href=\"https://wpvulndb.com/\">WordPress</a> and <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/security\">Drupal</a> on and off, even more so since listening to security podcasts like <a href=\"http://risky.biz/\">Risky Biz</a>.</p>\n<p>What I never thought I'd say is my site is now somewhat...open-source? You can find all of its code on my GitHub project <a href=\"https://github.com/calvinbui/calvin.me\">calvinbui/calvin.me</a>. There, you can find some drafts I'm working on as well if you want to spoil yourself.</p>\n<p>To sum up my own experience for the transition:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Was a pain to get it transitioned properly, <a href=\"https://github.com/calvinbui/calvin.me/graphs/commit-activity\">total time 1.5 weeks</a></li>\n<li>Used <a href=\"https://github.com/thomasf/exitwp\">exitwp</a> to convert it over, not a perfect tool.</li>\n<li>exitwp didn't run too well on Windows, had to use a Linux machine.</li>\n<li>exitwp didn't like how my site was self-hosted, had to transition it over to WordPress.com first.</li>\n<li>Images did not link properly but with some magic find and replace regex I was able to link them all properly.</li>\n<li>Images with captions did not display properly as they weren't supported, <a href=\"https://github.com/calvinbui/calvin.me/commits/master/_includes/caption.html\">but I overcame that</a></li>\n<li>WordPress galleries did not transition over.</li>\n<li>No Jekyll themes supported a 'featured-image' of any sort. <a href=\"https://github.com/calvinbui/calvin.me/commit/0d674dc8ac464c9e648d29ddbc69412f1db12651\">This was also added manually by me.</a></li>\n<li>Code blocks and lists didn't go well together. <a href=\"https://github.com/calvinbui/calvin.me/commit/72755d82330af82a411cf3bbd6d117d1514c5d5f\">This was worked around by just not using lists.</a></li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://github.com/github/pages-gem\">GitHub pages gem</a> is running into issues at the moment so the whole time what I was seeing locally was different from what eventually appeared.</li>\n<li>Creating pull requests led to <a href=\"https://github.com/503.html\">GitHub unicorning</a>. I believe it was because I forked from the <a href=\"https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now\">Jekyll Now theme</a> so I had to just start fresh to get rid any issues there.</li>\n<li>YouTube embeds worked with some tweaking to <a href=\"https://benmarshall.me/responsive-iframes/\">stretch them out a little</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466255-importing-comments-from-wordpress\">Moving comments</a> over from Disqus was easy enough.</li>\n<li>The list of <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/versions/\">approved plugins</a> is appalling. Couldn't make use of the <a href=\"https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-archives\">Jekyll Archives plugin</a> to create categories.</li>\n<li>At least the site is faster? (not really)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm happy with how it eventually turned out despite the trouble. It is much simpler to read and make changes to. I don't need a slew of plugins to get everything running perfectly like on WordPress, because it just works.</p>\n<p>Other notes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Security is not as big of a concern, the only way in is through GitHub, CloudFlare or Namecheap.</li>\n<li>Response and speeds are now managed by GitHub and CloudFlare CDNs.</li>\n<li>Free hosting I guess?</li>\n<li>This list probably repeats what everyone else has already said :pensive:</li>\n</ul>","timeToRead":3,"excerpt":"I've made the leap over from WordPress to Jekyll.
