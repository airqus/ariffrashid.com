Not techy at all and focuses on how we use computers to turn data into information through processes and tools. The lecturer did not speak English well and was very hard to understand. One classic lecture almost everyone remembers was the word 'beach' being repeatedly said and being interpreted as something else...The tutor almost always left the classroom for 30 mins at a time one of his 7 coffees. Knows everybody so always stops for a chat doing so. Knowledgeable but not a great teacher.</p>\n<h3 id=\"48023-programming-fundamentals\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#48023-programming-fundamentals\" aria-label=\"48023 programming fundamentals permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>48023 Programming Fundamentals</h3>\n<p><strong>Enrolled during</strong>: Autumn 2012</p>\n<p><strong>Lecturer quality</strong>: 8/10</p>\n<p><strong>Tutor quality</strong>: 9/10</p>\n<p><strong>Mark</strong>: High Distinction</p>\n<p><strong>Thoughts</strong>: Lecturer and tutor were very good and took time to explain Java concepts to the students.

During the final exam, the lecturer comes in and tells everyone to fill in a survey about the subject during our exam time.

Do not do the Diploma unless you have to (i.e. the internship requires it). The Diploma is this in a nutshell:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Find your own job</li>\n<li>Write a diary of everything you do everyday</li>\n<li>Write a 5000 page report each semester</li>\n<li>Make a SWAT analysis of yourself</li>\n<li>Pay the course fee of $1000</li>\n<li>In return you will get: nothing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I remember taking on this degree specifically for this 1 year worth of industry experience. What a great trick UTS plays to lure you in. The people in charge at UTS that run this program are horrible to work with. They play favourites when it comes to job applications that have to go through them if an employer wishes to reach out. I attended an afternoon tea with MLC once and most of the teams there were interested in me and thought I would fit in well. Who gets hired? Others with lower GPAs and less English proficiency than me.</p>\n<p>Fine, I'll get my own job. But no, if you get your own job you have get it approved through a system that does not even work. Calling up the owner of the system and asking him to help you out will get you no where as well. Eventually you stop caring about the system and so do they thankfully.</p>\n<p>The year goes by and you have send in your diary and 5000 word report to whoever's in charge of these subjects. The end of year results are released and they aren't marked yet. If subject is pending on your student record your GPA sits at zero (0.00). This isn't good when you're now in your 4th and final year and have to start applying for Graduate roles soon. Where is he? Oh he's overseas. When he gets back you email him and he says he never got it, even though you sent it a month before his leave asking for a receipt.</p>\n<p>I was tricked.</p>\n<h3 id=\"31285-mobile-applications-development\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#31285-mobile-applications-development\" aria-label=\"31285 mobile applications development permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>31285 Mobile Applications Development</h3>\n<p><strong>Enrolled during</strong>: Autumn 2014</p>\n<p><strong>Lecturer quality</strong>: 10/10</p>\n<p><strong>Tutor quality</strong>: 8/10</p>\n<p><strong>Mark</strong>: High Distinction</p>\n<p><strong>Thoughts</strong>: A wonderful mark (89) is what a great lecturer and tutor gives you.

That mark is then your mark. It is as stupid as it sounds. There's not feedback given from anybody besides the person that marked you. Most of the time they don't take it seriously and just give you full marks and no feedback. That makes you think your diagrams are okay, that there's nothing wrong with them. When it comes to the exam and assignment, you see why I got a pass. Oh, the entire class marks your assignment I might add. Lazy or something I'm not seeing?</p>\n<h3 id=\"31284-web-services-development\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#31284-web-services-development\" aria-label=\"31284 web services development permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>31284 Web Services Development</h3>\n<p><strong>Enrolled during</strong>: Spring 2014</p>\n<p><strong>Lecturer quality</strong>: 8/10</p>\n<p><strong>Tutor quality</strong>: 7/10</p>\n<p><strong>Mark</strong>: High Distinction</p>\n<p><strong>Thoughts</strong>: A continuation of Java programming which teaches how to run Java in the web browser using JSP.

The assignments revolve around you coming up with your own innovative idea to a pre-existing concept such as home appliances or coffee/tea. The tutorials are fun activities. The assignments can be very harshly marked however with very strong criticism of small things.</p>\n<h3 id=\"31272-project-management-and-the-professional\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#31272-project-management-and-the-professional\" aria-label=\"31272 project management and the professional permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>31272 Project Management and the Professional</h3>\n<p><strong>Enrolled during</strong>: Autumn 2015</p>\n<p><strong>Lecturer quality</strong>: 8/10</p>\n<p><strong>Tutor quality</strong>: 8/10</p>\n<p><strong>Mark</strong>: Distinction</p>\n<p><strong>Thoughts</strong>: The Project Management course offered at UTS, which should be similar to any other University.

You assume the role of a tester and run simple tests on a website provided to you. The lectures are quite long and do go off track quite a bit. My tutor was the worst I had ever had in my entire time at UTS. She knew nothing about the subject, had no background in it and did absolutely nothing during our tutorials. When it came to marking our first assignment, she gave quite random marks with zero feedback at all. After complaining, the second assignment was marked by the subject coordinator who similarly gave low marks with once again zero feedback.</p>\n<h3 id=\"31280-strategic-it-project\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#31280-strategic-it-project\" aria-label=\"31280 strategic it project permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>31280 Strategic IT Project</h3>\n<p><strong>Enrolled during</strong>: Spring 2015</p>\n<p><strong>Lecturer quality</strong>: 3/10</p>\n<p><strong>Tutor quality</strong>: 8/10</p>\n<p><strong>Mark</strong>: Distinction</p>\n<p><strong>Thoughts</strong>: The capstone subject to cap off the degree.

I chose this major instead of the others because I felt I already knew a lot about the technical side of IT and wanted to learn about the non-technical side and grow my business acumen. What a bad idea that was.</p>\n<p>My other major was Enterprise Systems Development, which is more or less programming. These subjects were all taught very well and my marks and how I rated the lecturer/tutor on average show this.</p>\n<p>With a better understanding of IT than I had 4-5 years ago I would have definitely opted to go to another University such as UNSW who are pioneering a lot of world-first projects across the world (cyber-security and quantum computing off the top of my head).</p>\n<p>If you must do this degree for whatever reason, I just have two tips: don't do the diploma and don't do the Business Information Systems major.</p>","timeToRead":14,"excerpt":"Today I graduate from UTS with my Bachelor of Science in IT degree.
