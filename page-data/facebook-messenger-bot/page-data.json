I wanted to promote them to friends in our group chat whenever possible, however possible. We occasionally talk about Table Tennis (TT for short) and also occasionally do 'Knock Knock' jokes on one another.

All the instructions are provided in the README.md file.</p>\n<p>Whenever a message is received, the bot will examine a message for a regular-expression match defined in the <code class=\"language-text\">database.json</code> file. When a match is found, it will send at random, a link to a video or GIF associated with that song. It will also (shamelessly) give the message that triggered it a heart-eyes reaction :heart_eyes:</p>","timeToRead":1,"excerpt":"My shameless Facebook Messenger bot that sends YouTube videos and GIFs if a message received matches a TWICE song.
