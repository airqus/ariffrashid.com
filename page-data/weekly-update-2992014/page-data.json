At first I ran into some issues because I chose not to use MS DNS and thought pfSense's DNS could handle it all. Bad idea, Active DIrectory worked but joining the domain never did. On the retry, I chose to install the DNS Server and it automatically started using my pfSense DNS as a forwarder. I believe this was because it previously had a static IP and grabbed it from there. I've connected my main computer to it as well as napp-it.</p>\n<p>I thought having a domain controller was going to be stupid for a home network but it really is quite nice. So far I can't think of a reason not to join my computers to the domain.</p>\n<h3 id=\"restored-var-folder-permissions\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#restored-var-folder-permissions\" aria-label=\"restored var folder permissions permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Restored /var/ folder permissions</h3>\n<p>Over the weekend I had some issues with this site's permissions so I decided to do a <em>chown</em> on the folder. Stupid me I did a <em>chown</em> on the ENTIRE /var folder which has things like MySQL running from its own account. Lots of issues came up so I had to find a way to fix it without starting again.</p>\n<p>I ended up following <a href=\"http://blog.matoski.com/articles/debian-restore-var-ownership-permissions/\">this guide from ilijamt</a>. The guide has quite a few spelling mistakes (e.g. get_selections instead of get-selections) and assumes you are a good Linux user to begin with.</p>\n<h3 id=\"took-a-db2-class\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#took-a-db2-class\" aria-label=\"took a db2 class permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Took a DB2 class</h3>\n<p>My department held a IBM DB2 class for University students. I attended it over 3 days to receive a certification :smile: My first but I hope to get a few over the next few years. Microsoft are apparently <a href=\"http://windowsitpro.com/cloud/microsoft-expands-its-outsourced-certifications-contract-pearson-online-exams\">revamping their exams</a> to reflect more real world situations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bought-a-new-domain\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#bought-a-new-domain\" aria-label=\"bought a new domain permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Bought a new domain</h3>\n<p>I bought a new domain (which I wish to keep secret) to host my download server on. I got it from the guys over at <a href=\"https://iwantmyname.com/\">iwantmyname</a>, a very nice and neat looking website. They put a lot of work into it to make it easy to use, buy a domain and funny as well (just look at any of the domain descriptions).</p>\n<p>The problem with their dynamic DNS implementation is that it is script based and uses email addresses as 'usernames' which do not work well in pfSense. After a little searching I found that Namecheap offer their <a href=\"https://www.namecheap.com/domains/freedns.aspx\">DNS service for free</a> and changed it straight over. Namecheap didn't support my domain extension or otherwise I would've bought it from them to begin with.  Now pfSense has two sites it is providing my IP address towards.</p>\n<h3 id=\"currently-interested-in\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#currently-interested-in\" aria-label=\"currently interested in permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Currently Interested In</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Connecting everything to my new shiny active directory. Single sign on everywhere :') Some things won't be supported like most of the things people want to use on my network (NZBDrone, CouchPotato etc.). There should be a HTTP authentication method through NGINX which connects to Active Directory.</li>\n<li>Once I get the Active Directory working properly the next step will be a RADIUS server. If it is what I think it is then I should be able to login to my WiFi using AD credentials...right?</li>\n<li>I got a IBM ServeRAID M5016 card from work. Right now I have absolutely no use for it but it would be good for future projects (like a proper storage host instead of an AIO).</li>\n</ul>","timeToRead":3,"excerpt":"In the weekly update, I bring you what I’ve been doing throughout Monday to Sunday in regards to technology, computers and more with links…","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/ariffrashid.com/ariffrashid.com/master/posts/2014/2014-09-28-weekly-update-2992014/index.md","frontmatter":{"title":"The Weekly Update (29/9/2014)","categories":["Misc"],"tags":["weekly update"],"thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":null,"extension":"svg","publicURL":"/static/c95dfb97d9b411d8374a7366ec09a6e4/thumbnail.svg"}}}},"pageContext":{"filter":"/^.*\\/\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}-weekly-update-2992014\\/.*$/"}},
