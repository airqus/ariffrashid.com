It's been a great experience, putting a lot of knowledge into practice with enterprise-grade hardware and software. The infrastructure at work is as you would expect with a lot of services and applications that are well thought out and easily to use. I wanted to learn a lot more about all the stuff at work so I came up with the idea to build my own ESXi whitebox at home (we use <a href=\"http://www.vmware.com\">VMware</a> at work) to do some self-learning and have fun while doing it. Having a 'homelab' would give me the opportunity to learn a lot more about the stuff I love. This is the build.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n<p>Thus began the long research into what I needed. Building your own server vs. buying a pre-built rack unit by IBM, Dell or HP really implores you to make sure every part you pick is thought out and compatible. <a href=\"http://www.vmware.com/resources/compatibility/search.php\">VMware's compatibility guide</a> can provide a starting point but can be outdated. Searching through Reddit's <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/\">HomeLabs</a> subreddit is also a good place to start with many people building their own white boxes instead of buying a pre-built unit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"all-in-one\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#all-in-one\" aria-label=\"all in one permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>All In One</h2>\n<p>I knew I wanted an all in one ESXi server that could both provide storage and computing for itself - that was a good place to start. Generally you would run a server and storage in separate machines so that you could erase the machine without worrying what would happen to your storage. With an all in one however the machine becomes married to the storage so if anything happens to either, I'm left with nothing. While this can be bad, it does save having to building another machine to just provide storage - reducing power bills, room real estate and extra maintenance.</p>\n<p>This was my first real server so it was a good starting point, perhaps in the future I could really ramp it up. But living by myself, having all these features and no users really doesn't affect anyone but myself during downtimes. Perhaps in the future when I'm living with roomies or get really serious with it I would definitely expand and mimic a enterprise as much as possible - and this means separated storage. Maybe when 10Gbps and Fibre Channel get cheaper?</p>\n<h2 id=\"server-goals-and-aspirations\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#server-goals-and-aspirations\" aria-label=\"server goals and aspirations permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Server Goals and Aspirations</h2>\n<h3 id=\"zfs\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#zfs\" aria-label=\"zfs permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>ZFS</h3>\n<p>For an all in one solution (AIO) I looked at <a href=\"http://www.napp-it.org/\">napp-it</a>, a web-based ZFS NAS/SAN solution. I had heard of ZFS when working with storage in my previous home server but now this gave me a chance to try it out - and why wouldn't I? Napp-it would essentially be running on the server providing software RAID to the ESXi host. Alternatives include <a href=\"http://www.nexenta.com\">Nexenta</a> (free up to 18TB) and <a href=\"http://www.freenas.org\">FreeNAS</a> (not recommended to be virtualised).</p>\n<p>But to even run napp-it, I first had to install it somewhere on the host so this is why I bought a cheap pair of Intel SSDs (shown below) and used napp-it's built in feature to mirror itself onto both drives - since if napp-it dies, none of the drives are going to be usable.</p>\n<p>The main reasons for using ZFS (if you can't find it online) to me were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>software RAID</li>\n<li>detects silent corruption</li>\n<li>end to end check-sums tests</li>\n<li>snapshots</li>\n<li>compression</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"single-points-of-failure\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#single-points-of-failure\" aria-label=\"single points of failure permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Single Points of Failure</h3>\n<p>From the point above, reducing single points of failures (SPOF) was also a goal. Basically a SPOF is the idea that if one specific part dies, it's gonna stop the entire system from working. Examples include having one power supply or one RAID card (so all your data gets lost). To best prevent this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>RAID where possible</li>\n<li>Buy popular parts in case I need a 2nd hand part after failure</li>\n<li>Long warranties products (5 years and up)</li>\n<li>Buy from reputable stores</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"infrastructure\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#infrastructure\" aria-label=\"infrastructure permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Infrastructure</h2>\n<p>I've learnt a lot of things at work (as I've said about) and there are a lot of things I'd like to implement into my own infrastructure.

I could justify this but many others could not. If you're on the fence about think about why you need one in the first place. For me I wanted to be able to have an environment where I was able to learn and gain valuable skills (I'm not that great at networking but I'm starting to get a good grip on it now) for the future.</p>\n<p>I don't think you can go wrong with whatever parts you pick if you think them out long and hard. Post your build over at some forum or /r/HomeLabs (linked above) to get some opinions from others. Every build is a little unique and personalised but I found a lot of people have gone the same route I have especially with the motherboard selection.</p>\n<p>Just have fun with whatever you do and don't stress if it doesn't work at first - that's when you really learn.</p>","timeToRead":11,"excerpt":"Since the start of the year I've been working as a Technical Consultant at IBM.
